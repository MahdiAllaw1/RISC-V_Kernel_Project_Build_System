# RISC-V_Kernel_Project_Build_System
This project implements a basic process kernel to simulate multitasking, allowing the creation and management of multiple processes with unique IDs and names. It includes timer-based scheduling, process initialization, and an idle process as a fallback. The focus is on understanding low-level system programming concepts in a simplified environment.
